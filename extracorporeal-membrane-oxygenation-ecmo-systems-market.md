<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) systems are classified into two main types: Veno-Arterial (VA) ECMO and Veno-Venous (VV) ECMO. VA ECMO supports both cardiac and respiratory function by returning oxygenated blood to the arterial system, making it suitable for patients with cardiac failure. In contrast, VV ECMO primarily addresses respiratory failure by oxygenating venous blood and returning it to the venous system, thus focusing on lung support. Both systems are crucial in critical care for severe cardiopulmonary conditions.</p></p>
