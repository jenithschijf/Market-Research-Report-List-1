<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Concentration Oxygen Masks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rebreathing High Concentration Oxygen Masks</li><li>Non-Rebreathing High Concentration Oxygen Masks</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The High Concentration Oxygen Masks market consists of two primary types: Rebreathing High Concentration Oxygen Masks and Non-Rebreathing High Concentration Oxygen Masks. Rebreathing masks allow the user to inhale a mix of oxygen and exhaled carbon dioxide, providing higher oxygen concentrations, often used for patients needing moderate oxygen support. In contrast, Non-Rebreathing masks are designed with a one-way valve that prevents exhaled air from re-entering, delivering nearly pure oxygen, making them ideal for critical care scenarios requiring maximum oxygen delivery.</p></p>
