<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spiral Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spiral Separators</li><li>Dry Spiral Separators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spiral separator market is divided into two main types: wet spiral separators and dry spiral separators. Wet spiral separators use water to enhance the separation process, effectively concentrating minerals and removing impurities in a slurry. They are typically utilized in mineral processing and recycling applications. In contrast, dry spiral separators operate without water, relying on gravity and air for material separation, making them ideal for dry materials in industries like aggregates and waste management. Both types cater to specific operational needs and material characteristics.</p></p>
